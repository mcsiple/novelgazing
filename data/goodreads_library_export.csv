Yes- we need to talk more about masculinity and what our vision is for the future of gender (if you are thinking of reading this, I recommend bell hooks’s “The Will To Change” first).  <br/><br/>This book was generally good. I loved Part I, and found that the personal stories she included from men were some of the most fascinating parts. I’m just going to run through a couple things that need to be better addressed in the future on this topic, because I am pedantic!<br/><br/>The second half reads like it’s target audience is MRAs: “feminism will help you die less and have more money! Don’t you want that?” The nadir was the section “The Post #MeToo Rules” which instructs men (?) how to act at work now that they’re scared of accidentally harassing someone. It actually suggests that men “follow the official policy that was instituted at Facebook and Google: you only get one shot.” I’m sorry...what? No, you don’t get any shots! Work is for doing your job! Also- I have to be critical of any feminist book that actually suggests people follow a corporate policy to avoid getting “#MeToo’ed”. Honestly, folks. Rule 3 follows: “if the attraction is mutual it’s not harassment.” Actually, it can still be harassment! I feel like this chapter was a soft pitch pleading w men to achieve the bare minimum in not terrorizing their colleagues. In my experience, Rule 3 is a loophole exploited by MANY harassers, and its irresponsible to put it here. I felt similarly betrayed by the following chapters. <br/><br/>Essentially, the first half of the book laid out a lot of important stuff we need to examine about gender identity. I was ready for rigor! But the second half was a fluffy pillow for MRAs and a messy flip-flop between gender in the US and in other cultures worldwide. There was a random mindfulness section and then an “empathy” part that seemed to suggest everyone just needs to be nicer to men (??). <br/><br/>Part I gets 5 starts, part 2 gets 2.5, I round up because I think Plank is funny and Sam Irby seems to like her —> 4 stars total ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I think the author has a podcast, and this book reads kind of like a podcast.

Steve’s breathless enthusiasm is UNPARALLELED and the book is a refreshing jaunt through an extremely fascinating topic. Dinosaurs for life.<br/><br/>Post-script: I am editing this after thinking for a while about how this book managed to mention the accomplishments of lots of different colleagues  without being annoying. Based on other reviews, it sounds like a lot of people were turned off by what they saw as name-dropping. The personal anecdotes in the book didn't feel like name-dropping to me, but I often am an eye roller par excellence when scientists talk about their buddies. One of the things that stuck out to me was how fastidiously he acknowledges all the incredible work that other researchers have done. I felt that compared to a lot of other scientists who (sometimes misguidedly) decide to write pop science books, he does not put his connections front and center, but he does weave everyone's personality into their research, and talk about his personal interactions with them. So, I think the way he mentions other scientists is great, contra many other reviews of this book.<br/><br/>I would also like to add that there is a wistful/sad component for me about this book, which is that it did leave me with this feeling that science, and successful scientists, are these outlandish creatures who recognize each other and stick together, publish brilliant papers, travel constantly, and have lots of camaraderie with beer. When I think about this in my own field, it makes me mad. But somehow when I was reading this book, I mostly enjoyed it as a scene of a world so far from my own that it didn't leave me feeling left out. Sort of like, watching Indiana Jones of dinosaurs with a cool dorky lovable dude at the center, instead of whatever Indy was. But there is certainly some sadness drifting around afterwards. Someday I will have a supportive and loving science club where we all think each other are geniuses. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It is an admirable effort. I felt like he mostly wrote at a level for the fisheries-literate— but then lapses into explaining, for example, what carrying capacity is for several paragraphs. I thought the ecological explanations were not super great, and that most of the time he was doing the dance all science writers must do—trying to make all your sources happy with how you represented them and their work, AND being accurate about uncertainty—but he stuck too far on the safe side of that, putting in too much detail in a sporadic way that made it hard to tell what was essential. As far as fisheries books goes, it’s fine...and it was fun to read about my colleagues :)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

However, I found it to be very self-indulgent, replete with unnecessary examples, and without a lot of real mental challenges. I think the final nail in the coffin was the summary/epilogue where the author, in a few pages, tries to address sexism at work by saying women should be more [aggressive/forward-thinking/less blame-y, less victim-y], and says the pope should have run for President in 2016. Biiiitch! Are you serious?? I’m outta here. I like the main principles, but you could just read the titles of the book sections in the table of contents and get 95% of what I got from this book.

It is an amazing tale, Elizabeth Holmes is such an unrepentant weirdo and there are so many interesting other characters in the story. It is verrrrry enthralling just as a thriller but also has a lot to teach us about silicon valley culture, white collar crime, patriarchy (I would argue, embodied and then twisted by the clearly very conditioned and very driven Elizabeth Holmes to [almost] achieve her goal), and privilege.

Somehow it ended up on my list of books I wanted to read, likely because of my obsession with the gnarly underworld of the “manosphere” and its relationship to the 2016 election. Nagel’s thesis is basically that young people from the left and right are all hipsters and cling to different ideas because they yearn to be counterculture. I think this is bogus. In addition to be academically lazy (anyone who refers to a group of people by a social media tool + their political alignment, e.g., “tumblr feminist” is not to be trusted — the book is poorly edited or perhaps not edited at all — she has almost no citations), she devotes great energy to sympathizing with 4chan devotées and various /r/‘s (that shall remain unnamed until I can recommend a better book about them) and distancing herself from other feminists in what appears to be a sloppy attempt to appear “balanced” in her opinions.

I hope that there are more memoirs by modern women in science so I can read them-- I think I'm particularly sensitive about this book because I don't want people to think her experience or path is typical.

But there are also glorious, bright sci-fi bits, lots of sly moments, and everything is suffused with Roxane Gay's razor sharp wit and calm, direct style. I like these stories because they feel personal to me, like they are what she really wanted to write. And I love the seductive moments when the short stories become ultra-sexy romance stories, just for a page. I can feel the nerdy, hella romantic fantasy, and I'm 100% here for it. <br/><br/>I loved ""Requiem for a Glass Heart"" and ""Open Marriage"" -- amazing for very different reasons.

I read shadows of many dude-types that I have encountered in my life, in this book. I will save a couple of my favorite pithy quotes here, and then sell it on amazon marketplace because I can't bear to hear another dude tell Anaïs Nin that she ""isn't like the others"":<br/><br/>P. 132: ""Allendy talks, perhaps to ease his own doubts. He stresses my frailness, my naïveté, whereas I, with a deeper instinct, choose friends who arouse my energy, who make enormous demands on me, who are capable of enriching me with experience, pain, people like Henry and June who do not believe me naïve or innocent, but who challenge my keenest wisdom, who have the courage to treat me like a woman in spite of the fact that they are aware of my vulnerability.""<br/><br/>p. 245-247: an amazing section in which Artaud writes A. Nin a scathing letter. He sounds amazingly like a toxic sexist nerd of today. <br/>My favorite line: ""Because he did not believe me when I tried to say 'I do not want you as a lover,' and now he was blaming me for my weakness. I let him...I let him pronounce his anathemas, curses, as a malefic, dangerous being, black magic, and he seemed more and more like an outraged castrated monk.""
